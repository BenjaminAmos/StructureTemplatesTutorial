# StructureTemplatesTutorial
A tutorial describing the creation and usage of the StructureTemplates module in Terasology.

The tutorial should guide you through the process of building structures, using the structure tools,
spawning structures and interacting with them through code in other modules. By the end of the tutorial,
you should have created a new module, a structure template prefab for it and the spawn system to place it in your new worlds.
